            			In 2018 SpaceX was making market-shaking advancements in 
            			rocket technology. Their influence spurred on a rivival of
            			space-travel companies. Our origins lie within SpaceX. Our founders
            			were head engineers at SpaceX, directly responsible for some of
            			the more notable advancements in rocket technology. In late 
            			2018, these few engineers proposed a new direction for the
            			company- space travel. The proposal made its way to Elon Musk
            			himself, who vehemently rejected it. This team of individuals
            			bound together and left SpaceX with vivid dreams of new planets
            			and destinations with awesome tourist activities.
